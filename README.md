# CustomSMTPServer
Developing an advanced email server is a complex task that requires knowledge of email protocols, networking, and security. Here's a basic example of how you can create a simple email server using Python's built-in smtpd module

In this code, we are defining a custom SMTP server class that extends the smtpd.SMTPServer class. The process_message() method is called for each incoming email message, and prints the message details to the console. We then define the server settings, such as the hostname and port number to listen on, and create an instance of our custom SMTP server class. Finally, we start the server using the asyncore.loop() function, which continuously listens for incoming email messages and processes them using our custom server class.

Note that this is a very basic example and does not include important features such as authentication, encryption, spam filtering, and message storage. Creating a production-ready email server requires a deep understanding of email protocols and security, as well as the use of robust email server software and frameworks.
